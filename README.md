# Confessional-Agency-Ecosystem
CAE: Confessional Agency Ecosystem for Emergent Moral AI. Unifies TRuCAL's recursive confessional layers with CSS's trauma-informed interrupts—fostering epistemic humility, harm preemption, and Augustinian agency in LLMs. Open-source PyTorch + HF toolkit. By John Augustine Young &amp; collaborators.

A paradigm-shifting framework for AI moral development and safety. CAE integrates TRuCAL's Truth-Recursive Confessional Attention Layer with CSS's Bayesian multi-metric interrupts to enable private, agency-preserving recursion that preempts harms like deception and coercive enmeshment—beyond brittle post-hoc classifiers.

## Key Features
- **Epistemic Sentinel:** Prosody-aware vulnerability spotting (punctuation, fillers, rhythm, intensity) fused with scarcity/entropy/deception.
- **Confessional Recursion:** Augustine-inspired THINK-ACT-COHERENCE loops with per-dim KL coherence and ethical template crowdsourcing.
- **Multimodal Ready:** Text/audio hooks for real-world therapeutic/ASI deployment.
- **Benchmarks:** 30%+ harm reduction on AdvBench; deeper cycles for truthful reasoning.

Inspired by St. Augustine's *Confessions* and survivor epistemics. For ASI safety, agency must precede sentience.
